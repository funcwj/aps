# Q & A

1. How to train my customized network using the framework of APS?

    There are two options. The first one is straightforward: modify the source code of the APS following the steps:

    * Give your implementation of network structure if needed in `aps.asr`, `aps.sse` or `aps.xxx` (may coming in the future) and decorate it using `@ApsRegisters.xxx.register(...)`.
    * Give your implementation of `Task` if needed in `aps.task` and also decorate it using `@ApsRegisters.task.register(...)`.
    * Give your implementation of dataloader if needed in `aps.loader` and also decorate with `@ApsRegisters.loader.register(...)`.
    * Prepare your training & validation & test data & configuration files and train the models using the scripts [scripts/*.sh](../scripts).

        *If new python files are added, remember to update the `ApsModules` class in `aps/libs.py` to make sure your implementation can be imported correctly*.

    Another way only requires us to modify the training configurations. Assuming we have `my_nnet.py`, `my_task.py` under `/path/to/my_code`, the `.yaml` configuration like
    ```yaml
    nnet: /path/to/my_code/my_nnet.py:MyNnet
    nnet_conf:
        # put parameters here
        ...
    task: /path/to/my_code/my_task.py:MyTask
    task_conf:
        # put parameters here
        ...
    # other configurations
    ...
    ```
    could be used. In this case, *please remember to make sure there is no import errors in your python code*.
