# Known issues

1. The recipes under [examples/asr](../examples/asr) are not guaranted to achieve STOA results as the author doesn't spend much time tuning on them. Previously the part of the ASR code is wrote for interal dataset.

2. The code in each module are refactored and optimized several times thus the configuration & recipe examples may be out-of-date.

3. For ASR decoding, the author recommend [cmd/decode.py](../cmd/decode.py) as the batch version will bring slightly worse results.

4. At the early stage, the APS aims to support jit exporting features which could simplify the cost of model deployment. Currently not all the supported models are tested for this feature.

5. The PyTorch-based feature extraction (ASR part) are not guaranted to get same results as [Kaldi](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi), but it can be modified if you are familiar with the extraction process in Kaldi.

6. The implementation of the APS's network module (i.e., `aps.asr`, `aps.sse`) is based on author's personal knowledge thus the mismatch between the code and paper may exist.
